## Update: New Features 

We are excited to introduce two new features that enhance the functionality of the software:

1. **Saving Tasks to a File**
   - The new `SaveData` class allows users to save all tasks to a file.
   - Tasks are stored in a clear and structured format, including title, description, due date, and status.

2. **Loading Tasks from a File**
   - The new `ReadData` class enables users to load tasks directly from a file.
   - The software automatically reads and recognizes saved information such as title, description, due date, and status.

These features improve the user experience, making task management even easier and more efficient!

### Example of the New File Format
After saving tasks to a file, the structure looks like this:
Title: Sample Task To Do: Task description Due Date: 2025-01-24 Status: completed
